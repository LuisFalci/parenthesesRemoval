# Parentheses Removal

In windows, we can't remove parentheses of two or more files/pastes at the same time.
To bypass this impossibility, I provided a code to remove all parentheses from the files in a folder at once.
To use the code available in this repository, you need access the code of parenthesesRemoval.bat and change the local of the paste you want to change all files.
You can do this open with note de .bat file and change the line third line "pushd "D:\HD Giovanni\AHJF_FCMI\" to "pushd yourFilesLocation"
